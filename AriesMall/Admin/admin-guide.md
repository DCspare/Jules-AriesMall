### Creating a Professional Slide
1.  Click the **"Main Site Slides"** tab.
2.  Click **"Add New Slide"**.
3.  **Choose Your Style:**
    *   **Style A (Text Overlay):** Upload a clean background photo. Enter a "Title" and "Description". Set "Show Dark Overlay" to **Yes** so the text is readable.

## 🎨 Media Hub (Images & AI)

The Media Hub is your tool for creating high-quality visuals without needing Photoshop.

### 1. Image Enhancer (AI Fixer)
Use this tool to fix blurry, pixelated, or low-quality product photos.
1.  **Upload:** Drag & drop your image or paste a URL.
2.  **Start:** Click **"Start Batch Enhancement"**.
3.  **Wait:** The AI will sharpen details, remove blur, and fix faces.
4.  **Result:** Once done, click the **Copy Link** button. You can now paste this high-quality link into the Product Manager.

### 2. Image Upscaler (Resolution Booster)
Use this for Hero Banners that need to be huge (4K) without losing quality.
1.  **Upload:** Drop your banner image.
2.  **Scale:** Choose **2x** (usually sufficient) or **4x**.
3.  **Start:** Click **"Start Batch Upscaling"**.
4.  **Result:** Use the generated link for your "Desktop Slider" images.

### 3. Smart Uploader (Hosting)
Use this for images that are already good quality and just need to be hosted online.
1.  **Add File:** Select a file or paste a URL.
2.  **Rename (Optional):** Give it a clear name (e.g., `iphone-15-black`) for easier finding later.
3.  **Upload:** Click the cloud icon.
4.  **Copy Links:** The tool provides optimized links:
    *   Use **"Product Image"** (Square) for products.
    *   Use **"Desktop/Mobile Slider"** for banners.

### 💡 Pro Tips
*   **Aspect Ratio:** For products, always try to use square images. If your image isn't square, the site will automatically crop it to the center, so ensure the product is centered!
*   **History:** The Media Hub keeps a "History" tab of your recent uploads and AI generations in case you lose a link.
